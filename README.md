# Alipt - A split Alice prototype 

The *Alipt* keyboard is a split keyboard prototype in the Alice layout, but with rotary encoder and OLED display. 

The goal is to design a board suited for myself as there are no boards designed quite like the Alice. Most split boards are generally based on an Ortho-linear layout. 

The keyboard is based off [the Sofle Keyboard from Josef](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard), with adjustments made to fit the preferred layout. 

## ToDo
